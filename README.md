# Recipe Recommender Using LLM
This project creates a recipe recommender using a large language model (LLM) from OpenAI. The system prompts the user to enter a recipe of their choice and then displays ten food suggestions based on that input. Afterward, the user selects one of the ten options, and the system provides complete details for the selected recipe.
